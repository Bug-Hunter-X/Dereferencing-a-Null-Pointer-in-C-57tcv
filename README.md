This repository contains a simple C program demonstrating a common programming error: dereferencing a null pointer.  The example shows how this can lead to program crashes or unpredictable results. The solution demonstrates how to correctly handle pointers and prevent this type of error.  It includes robust error checks to ensure that the program operates safely even with invalid inputs.
